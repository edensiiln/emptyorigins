## notes
This datapack was designed for a particular modpack and as such, interacts with a lot of content mods. Using it without some of those mods may still partially work, but some origins and powers will fail to load.
It isn't intended to be played with other origins datapacks \(except for size-altering ones such as [Tinkerer's Statures](https://modrinth.com/datapack/tinkerers-statures)\) and by default, overwrites other origins on the default layer, including those added by Origins itself.
